# CTAnon
An unofficial anonymous notification board for the Chicago Transit Authority

# User Story
* As a regular rider of the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) L train lines
* I want a place to post and view notifications for the train lines
* So that I can stay up to date on potential issues which would affect my commute

# Business Context
The current transit app (Ventra) has a significant delay when reporting issues and is limited to only a few specific messages/notifications. Our user-submitted reports allow riders to view important and relevant information much quicker.
